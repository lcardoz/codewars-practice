This is a repo where I practice codewars challenges in javascript, here in the README i will list the problems, my solutions will be in index.js

1. Grasshopper - Debug sayHello

Debugging sayHello function
The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

Example output:

Hello, Mr. Spock

2. Split Strings

Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']

3. Transportation on vacation

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

4. Who likes it?

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.

5. Grasshopper - Personalized Message

Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

Use conditionals to return the proper message:

case	                    return
name equals owner	        'Hello boss'
otherwise	                'Hello guest'

6. Replace With Alphabet Position

Given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example:

alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )
