This is a repo where I practice codewars challenges in javascript, here in the README i will list the problems, my solutions will be in index.js

1. Grasshopper - Debug sayHello

Debugging sayHello function
The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

Example output:

Hello, Mr. Spock

2. Split Strings

Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']

3. Transportation on vacation

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

4. Who likes it?

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.

5. Grasshopper - Personalized Message

Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

Use conditionals to return the proper message:

case	                    return
name equals owner	        'Hello boss'
otherwise	                'Hello guest'

6. Replace With Alphabet Position

Given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example:

alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )

7. Sum of two lowest positive integers

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.

8. Create Phone Number

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) 
// => returns "(123) 456-7890"

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

9. Is a number prime?

Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Requirements
You can assume you will be given an integer input.
You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well ( or 0 ).
NOTE on performance: There are no fancy optimizations required, but still the most trivial solutions might time out. Numbers go up to 2^31 ( or similar, depending on language ). Looping all the way up to n, or n/2, will be too slow.
Example
is_prime(1)  /* false */
is_prime(2)  /* true  */
is_prime(-1) /* false */

10. Parse nice int from char problem

You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.

11. 5 without numbers !!

Write a function that always returns 5

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/

12. Multiplication table

Your task, is to create N×N multiplication table, of size provided in parameter.

For example, when given size is 3:

1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9

For the given example, the return value should be:

[ [1,2,3], [2,4,6], [3,6,9] ]

13. Super Duper Easy

Make a function that returns the value multiplied by 50 and increased by 6. If the value entered is a string it should return "Error".

14. Grasshopper - Messi goals function

Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:

LaLiga
Copa del Rey
Champions
Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.

Note: the input will always be valid.

For example:

5, 10, 2  -->  17

15. What's the real floor?

Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor (due to superstition).

Write a function that given a floor in the american system returns the floor in the european system.

With the 1st floor being replaced by the ground floor and the 13th floor being removed, the numbers move down to take their place. In case of above 13, they move down by two because there are two omitted numbers below them.

Basements (negatives) stay the same as the universal level.

Examples
1  =>  0 
0  =>  0
5  =>  4
15  =>  13
-3  =>  -3

16. Sum of Digits / Digital Root

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples
16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2

17. Sum of Parts

Let us consider this example (array written in general format):

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

Its following parts:

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [3, 6, 10]
ls = [6, 10]
ls = [10]
ls = []

The corresponding sums are (put together in a list): 
[20, 20, 19, 16, 10, 0]

The function parts_sums (or its variants in other languages) will take as parameter a list ls and return a list of the sums of its parts as defined above.

Other Examples:
ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
parts_sums(ls) -> [21, 20, 18, 15, 11, 6, 0]

ls = [744125, 935, 407, 454, 430, 90, 144, 6710213, 889, 810, 2579358]
parts_sums(ls) -> [10037855, 9293730, 9292795, 9292388, 9291934, 9291504, 9291414, 9291270, 2581057, 2580168, 2579358, 0]

Note: Take a look at performance: some lists have thousands of elements.

18. Get the Middle Character

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

Examples:
Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

Input:
A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

Output:
The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

19. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

20. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

21. First Unique Character in a String

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

22. Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
